# ml_models
The repository contains implementations of basic machine learning models which are used initially on any problem to set a benchmark. Implementations are done using scikit-learn and hand coded implementations of some simpler algorithms are also given. The models are given for demonstration puposes only and hence have not been optimized much. For the same reason, the models are trained on sample datasets like titanic, iris and boston housing.

The following algorithms are covered:
- Linear Regression
- k Nearest Neighbour Classification
- k Means Clustering
- PCA for dimensionality reduction
- Decision Tree (with visualizations)
- Ensemble algorithms (Bagging, Boosting, Voting Classifier)
